# CPPIIW23
This project builds a Book Inventory application using parsed data from a .json file. Its current functionality includes: logging in or creating accounts (with password-encryption), retrieving books, adding/removing books from inventory, creating a shopping list, an admin menu for changes to user-login information, and the option to "purchase" a book. It uses .csv files to read/write relevant information (such as writing a user's shopping list for export) and incorporates a SQLite database to store and update information about books and/or shoppers. Additional features using QT Creator are upcoming.
